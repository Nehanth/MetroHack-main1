# Nosos


This project is submitted for [MLH - MetroHacks 2022 Hackathon](https://metrohacks-2022.devpost.com/)

---

The Idea behind **Nosos** is to build a hassle-free web application which will **detect your Genetic Disease at your fingerprints**.Our application will let yot be able to upload your fingerprints to see if you have genetic markers to any diseases.

# Technology Stack Used:

#### Libraries Used 
- Streamlit
- CoreMl
- Pandas
- Numpy
- OpenCv

#### APIs used
- Google Map API for Places: It's searching for nearby hospitals with doctors specialising in the disease that the model detects by uploading fingerprints.

## What it does?🤔
Our application utilizes machine learning to predict what genetic disease you may have, from just your finger tips! We then recommend you specialized doctors based on your type of disease, if our model predicts you're healthy we'll suggest you a general doctor.


## How we built it ⚙️
We used CoreML and Google Map's API for our backend and used streamlit for out front end


## Installation/Execution ✅



## Challenges we ran into 💻
Proof of concept was shown for our idea. We ran into many roadblocks (as most projects do) and almost quit at one point,
but we persevered throughout the night and implemented everything we planned to


## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆
Our team was pretty familiar with ML and API requests, but we had minimal expereince with front end development.
It was a struggle to implement everything in our easy-to-use website.


## Next Steps for our project
The next step would be to acquire better data sets. Our current data set is minimal. With more in depth data sets we would be
able to furhter our model and increase its accuracy.
